# Astrophotography

Here at Krittika, two of our favourite hobbies are stargazing and astrophotography. We frequently conduct stargazing sessions at the Gymkhana ground. And when the skies are bright, we try to capture their beauty in our DSLRs. But, to be able to process that data into beautiful pictures is a difficult task.

Ravi, a club member from the 2022-23 team, has written an excellent blog explaining [Astro Image Processing](https://ravioli1369.github.io) in great detail.  
As part of Learnersâ€™ Space, we conducted a course on Astronomical Imaging. The course consisted of various modules covering the basics of astrophotography, the equipment required, and the post-processing techniques.

#### Modules covered:

* [Introduction to Imaging Systems](https://krittikaiitb.github.io/Learners'_Space/Astrophotography/Introduction%20to%20Imaging%20Systems.pdf)  
* [Understanding Space Telescopes](https://krittikaiitb.github.io/Learners'_Space/Astrophotography/Understanding%20Space%20Telescopes.pdf)  
* [Image Sensors](https://krittikaiitb.github.io/Learners'_Space/Astrophotography/Image%20Sensors.pdf)  
* [Stacking and Filters](https://krittikaiitb.github.io/Learners'_Space/Astrophotography/Stacking%20and%20Filters.pdf)  
* [Photometry and Spectroscopy](https://krittikaiitb.github.io/Learners'_Space/Astrophotography/Photometry%20and%20Spectroscopy.pdf)
